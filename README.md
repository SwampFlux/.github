# Swamp Flux

Since moving to South Carolina, I've been a part of a meaningful change. I brought my skill and my desire to start a business here. The confederate flag came down. The houses here sink into the ground. Civil justice and political awareness is up. Cryptocurrency. Gig culture. The south is changing. I am part of that change. We are in flux. Flux, the tree sap derived substance that when heated turns into a toxic gas that keeps out oxygen and lowers the melting point of solder, the substance that binds together a circuit board.

Most of my efforts are Eurorack synth modules. Some are planned to be open source while many others are not hence what you see below is not the full list.
